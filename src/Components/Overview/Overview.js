            <span className='secondaryText'>To achieve national development  Nigeria had embarked on various
              Civil Service reforms dating back to pre-independence, some of which includes; Harragin Commission
               1946, Gorsuch Commission 1954, Mbanefo Commission 1959, Adeyinka Morgan Commission 1963, Adebo Salaries
                and wages Commission 1971, Udoji  Reforms 1988, Ayinla Panel of 1994, Monetization (Public Policy Reform)
                 2003, Pension Reform act 2004. Other reforms that contributed to certain degree of positive change in the
                  Civil Service through the journey to actualizing holistic transformation in a democratic era include; the
                   Pension Administration; Tenure Policy System; Manpower capacity building; Service Delivery (SERVICOM);
                    Electronic Payment, National Health Insurance Scheme; etc. Most of these reforms did not actualize the
                     total sum of the objectives for which they were set up. The National Strategy for Public Service Reforms 
                     (NSPSR) which has an overarching “long-term agenda to guide the rebuilding and transformation of reforms 
                     in the Public Service is built on four Pillars, each of which is fashioned around achieving the set objectives 
                     of rebuilding and transforming the Service into a world class Public Service by the year 2025. Civil 
                     Administration Reforms which is the fourth Pillar of the NSPSR, focuses specifically on improvement in 
                     the management of the civil service, rather than the wider Public Service. In view of administration, 
                     through the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation leveraged on pasts reforms initiatives 
                     and present needs assessment of the Service to Come out with the Federal Civil Service Strategy & implementation 
                     plan (FCSSIP)-2017-2020. As an in-house strategy document with an intent to revamp and reposition the Service 
                     for optimal performance. The plan has provision to implement the fourth pillar of NSPSR and is hinged on 
                     eight (8) priority. Summarily, the Public/Civil Service Administration & Management is humongously dynamic, 
                     hence there will always be evolution in terms of reforms to meet international best practices and demands.
